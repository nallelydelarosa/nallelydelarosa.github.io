<section>
  <p>Hi, I'm Nallely (/nah-yeh-lee/). I’m a Ph.D. student in Social Psychology at NYU, where I study how people perceive and respond to social inequalities.</p>

  <p>At NYU, I am a recipient of the Changemakers Center Leadership Fellowship, GSAS Dean’s Doctoral Fellowship, and MacCracken Fellowship. I earned my B.A. in Child and Adolescent Development from California State University Northridge (CSUN), where I conducted research in several labs focused on stereotyping, trauma, and intergroup dynamics. I’ve also trained with Dr. Mina Cikara’s Harvard Intergroup Neuroscience Lab and am currently a California State University Chancellor’s Doctoral Incentive Program (CDIP) Fellow, continuing my collaboration with Dr. Debbie Ma.</p>

  <p>My academic work explores how social environments shape motivation, perception, and behavior, especially among marginalized communities. Recently, my research has focused on how stereotypes can unintentionally reinforce inequities and create tension within and between minoritized groups. A key aspect of my research is developing strategies for effectively communicating disparities and inequalities to minoritized groups in ways that inspire action.</p>

  <p>Whether in the lab or applied settings, I’m driven by the belief that research should translate into impact.</p>

      <strong>Community & Connection</strong><br>

    <div class="approach-box" style="background-color: var(--highlight);">

  <h3 class="section-title">Research</h3>
  <p>I study stereotyping, prejudice, and social hierarchies, focusing on how socially accepted stereotypes influence identity, behavior, and inequality. My work spans multiple areas, including leadership perceptions, intergroup attitudes, face perception, social learning of bias, and health equity. A key aspect of my research is developing strategies for effectively communicating disparities and inequalities to minoritized groups in ways that inspire action.</p>
  
  <div class="research-grid">
    <div class="research-box">
      <h4>Perception &amp; Identity</h4>
      <p>I investigate how marginalized groups perceive and stereotype one another, particularly when stereotypes contain both positive and negative elements (mixed valence attitudes). While much of stereotype research focuses on overtly negative traits, socially accepted stereotypes may be equally, if not more, effective in maintaining inequality. My research explores: How do stereotypes held within marginalized communities shape intergroup perceptions and identity? When are group stereotypes internalized vs. resisted, and how does this impact behavior? How do social norms and system-justifying beliefs reinforce seemingly positive stereotypes?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="research-box">
      <h4>Identity &amp; Aspirations</h4>
      <p>I develop and test interventions that challenge stereotypic leadership beliefs among minoritized adolescents. Many young people hold rigid mental representations of leadership that exclude people who look like them, limiting their own aspirations. To address these questions, I helped design a leadership workshop aimed at breaking stereotypic beliefs and expanding leadership identity among racial and ethnic minority adolescents.Through this work, we have been able to collect data from and present to over 300 adolescents of color in NYC. </p>

  <h3 class="section-title">Mentorship</h3>
  <p>
    As a research mentor, I work closely with a team of 5–10 undergraduate research assistants, providing hands-on experience that prepares them for their professional and academic goals. This includes training in data handling, in-person and online data collection, participant management, stimulus creation, data analysis, and research presentations. Outside the lab, I also mentor fellow first-gen students and peers pursuing careers in science and research.

  </button>

  <div id="philosophyText" style="display: none; margin-top: 1rem;">
    <h4>Mentorship Philosophy Statement</h4>
    <p>
      I view mentorship as a vital component of my academic and professional journey. My approach to mentoring research assistants is grounded in the belief that each mentee brings a unique set of experiences, perspectives, and aspirations to the table...
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion.</strong> I am committed to fostering diversity and inclusion within the lab. I recognize that diversity extends beyond race and gender to include factors such as first-generation college status, socioeconomic background, type of institution previously attended, and experience in non-research or applied work settings. I believe that these diverse perspectives and experiences are invaluable, as they bring fresh insights and enrich our research, ultimately broadening our understanding of the world and the impact of our work. My goal as a mentor is to ensure that every research assistant feels respected, heard, and valued. I actively seek to understand each mentee’s unique background and tailor my mentoring approach to meet their individual needs. This includes providing additional support and resources for those who may be navigating the complexities of research and academia for the first time. I am committed to creating a safe space where all mentees can ask questions, express their ideas, and pursue their interests without fear of judgment. Additionally, I view my role as a mentor as an opportunity to challenge and push back against the established norms within academia that often disadvantage or fail to represent the full spectrum of lived experiences. I also recognize that it is my responsibility to remain open to feedback and criticism, especially when I am not fully living up to these values, so that I can continuously improve and better support my mentees.
      <strong>Supporting Academic and Professional Growth.</strong> I understand that research assistants are students first, with academic responsibilities and personal commitments that must be balanced alongside their research work. I emphasize the importance of time management and prioritize flexibility in our work schedules to accommodate their academic needs. My mentorship is designed to complement their academic journey, providing them with valuable research experience while also supporting their success in their coursework and other endeavors. In our lab, I encourage research assistants to set personal and professional goals, whether they are interested in pursuing graduate school, gaining skills for a specific career path, or simply exploring the field of research. I am committed to providing guidance, feedback, and opportunities for skill development that align with these goals. This may include offering feedback on personal statements or CVs, discussing career paths in research and beyond, and developing soft skills such as public speaking or scientific writing.
      <strong>Fostering Independence and Collaboration.</strong> I believe that effective mentorship involves a balance of guidance and independence. I aim to equip my mentees with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed while also encouraging them to take ownership of their work and develop their own research interests. I foster a collaborative lab environment where research assistants are encouraged to share ideas, work together, and learn from each other. Additionally, I am open to and actively encourage my mentees to pursue project lead roles, such as applying for the NYU Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund. I am committed to supporting them throughout the entire application process, from developing a research proposal to navigating the submission requirements, ensuring they have the confidence and resources needed to succeed in these leadership opportunities.
       <strong>Continuous Learning and Improvement.</strong> Mentorship is a dynamic process, and I am committed to continuously reflecting on and improving my mentoring practices. I seek feedback from my mentees to ensure that I am meeting their needs and helping them achieve their goals. My ultimate aim is to be a mentor who not only supports my research assistants in their current roles but also helps them build a strong foundation for their future academic and professional success.
